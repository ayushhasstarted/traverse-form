            <h3>What is Traverse?</h3>
            <p>A traverse is a form of control survey used in a wide variety of engineering and property surveys.
                Essentially, traverses are a series of established stations tied together by angle and distance.</p>

            <h3>Computation of Closed Traverse</h3>
            <p>This site aims to calculate the coorindate of unknown staions from two known stations. After measuring
                the observerd angles and the distance of corresponding traverse leg we can calculate the unknown
                coordinates. Bowditch rule is used for adjustment of closed Traverse. However this doesnot include
                computation of Reduced Level of the respective stations.
                We can here compute for both the clockwise and anticlockwise angle observation.
